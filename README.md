# Amazon-Product-Review-Analysis
This is a project I submitted during my Data Analysis class with Digital Skillup Africa (The Incubator Hub)

I have acquired very important skills, ranging from MS Excel, to SQL to Power BI and I'm building my portfolio with projects given by the academy.

      1. Data manipulation
      2. Data Munching

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation

  In the initial phase of the data cleaning, I did the following
  1. Data inspection
  2. Handling missing variables
  3. Data cleaning and formatting
 
  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the data such as;
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0,
4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200,
₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined
